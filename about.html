    <p> I grew up in a family of five. With two older brothers, I never seemed to get in to all the girly stuff. I followed what they did so I grew up riding dirt bikes and snowmobiles. I am extremely lucky and love every minute of it. Below are some pictures of me enjoying the things I am passionate about. </p>
    <p> I am really in to sustainibility and working towards making the world a greener place. I want to work for a company that is also passionate about that. I am really excited to start a career in Marketing after college. </p>
